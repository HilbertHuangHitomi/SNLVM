# Hyperspherical Neural Latent Variable Models

Implementation of SNLVM in Tensorflow2. This is adapted from https://github.com/HennigLab/tndm. To run SNLVM, you can install the environment based on the requirements of TNDM.

# Getting started

Run a model using:

	python Run.py --model SNLVM --times 1
	python Run.py --model LFADS --times 1
	python Run.py --model TNDM  --times 1
